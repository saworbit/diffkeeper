# DiffKeeper Release Notes

## v2.1 "Timeline UX" - November 28, 2025

**Status:** Preview (ready for CI adoption)

### Highlights
- **Timeline CLI:** `diffkeeper timeline` streams a chronological feed of filesystem writes with relative timestamps, so export targets are never a guess.
- **GitHub Action:** Composite `action.yml` enables `uses: saworbit/diffkeeper@v1` with automatic artifact upload of traces on failure.
- **Flaky Demo:** Added `demo/flaky-ci-test` and doc updates (README/quickstart) to show record ➜ timeline ➜ export in a few seconds.

### Notes
- Timeline reads Pebble metadata in read-only mode; no impact on recorded traces.
- Action installs via release installer and runs `diffkeeper record` with sudo to attach eBPF on Linux runners.

---

## v2.0 "Time Machine" - November 28, 2025

**Status:** Preview (CI/CD flight recorder)

### Highlights
- **Pebble Flight Recorder:** Replaced BoltDB with Pebble + key prefixes (`l:/c:/m:`) for high-throughput ingest and durable CAS storage.
- **Journal + Worker:** Added fast journal ingestion (pebble.NoSync) and async processor that hashes/compresses into CAS and metadata.
- **CLI Pivot:** New `record`/`export` commands to wrap commands, capture filesystem history, and time-travel restores.
- **Dogfooding CI:** GitHub Actions pipeline now self-tests the Time Machine workflow by recording a flaky script and verifying exports.
- **Documentation Refresh:** New README, architecture, quickstart, genesis/pivot narrative, and PIVOT_SPEC_V2; BoltDB-era docs/demos/workflows archived under `docs/archive/v1-legacy/`.

### Notes
- Windows/macOS builds verified in CI (fsnotify fallback); eBPF path covered on Linux via sudo in functional test.
- Legacy workflows and database demos preserved in `docs/archive/v1-legacy/` for reference.

## v2.0 Preview - November 18, 2025

**Status:** Preview (eBPF + streaming chunking)

### Highlights
- Prometheus metrics endpoint (`:9911/metrics`) with namespaced `diffkeeper_` capture, recovery, storage, store-size, and liveness signals; Go/process collectors enabled by default.
- New CLI/env: `--metrics-addr` / `DIFFKEEPER_METRICS_ADDR` to place the metrics server on a dedicated port.
- Streaming chunked diffs for huge files: Rabin-Karp content-defined chunking streams large files without OOM, compresses chunks with zstd, and replays via manifests.
- Chunk-aware CAS: SHA256-addressed chunk helpers with refcounts and transparent compression on reads/writes.
- New large-file metrics: `diffkeeper_chunk_total`, `diffkeeper_chunk_dedup_ratio`, `diffkeeper_chunk_capture_duration_ms`, `diffkeeper_large_file_tracked_total`.
- Config + CLI knobs: `--enable-chunking`, `--chunk-min/avg/max`, `--chunk-hash-window`, plus `--chunk-size` for fixed-size workflows.
- eBPF fallback hardening: cleaner logs and reliable fsnotify fallback when memlock is constrained.

### Notes for CI
- For runners with strict memlock, add `ulimit -l unlimited` before `go test` to silence eBPF warnings; fallback remains functional otherwise.
- Integration suite (chunking included): `go test -tags integration ./...`.

## v1.0 Final - November 8, 2025

**Status:** Production Ready

### Major Features

**Binary Diff Reconstruction Complete**
- Diff chain accumulation and reconstruction fully implemented
- 85.7% storage savings verified (exceeds 50-80% target)
- Sub-2ms recovery for 25-version diff chains
- Automatic periodic snapshots (every N versions)

### Performance Achievements

| Metric | Result | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Storage Savings** | **85.7%** | 50-80% | EXCEEDED |
| **Recovery Time** | 1.55ms | <100ms | EXCEEDED |
| **Diff Chain Length** | 25+ versions | 20+ | EXCEEDED |
| **Test Coverage** | 72/72 (100%) | 70+ | MET |

### What's New

**1. BaseSnapshotCID Tracking**
- Added `base_snapshot_cid` field to FileMetadata
- Enables diff chain reconstruction by tracking the base snapshot
- Snapshots self-reference, diffs inherit from previous version

**2. Diff Chain Accumulation**
- Diffs now accumulate all patches since last snapshot
- Example: Version 5 stores [diff1→2, diff2→3, diff3→4, diff4→5]
- Enables proper reconstruction from base + complete chain

**3. Proper reconstructFile() Implementation**
```go
// Fetch base snapshot
baseData := dk.cas.Get(meta.BaseSnapshotCID)

// Apply each diff sequentially
for _, diffCID := range meta.CIDs {
    diffPatch := dk.cas.Get(diffCID)
    current = dk.diffEngine.ApplyPatch(current, diffPatch)
}
```

**4. Periodic Snapshot Intervals**
- Removed force-snapshot mode
- Configurable snapshot interval (default: every 10 versions)
- Prevents diff chains from becoming too long
- Optimizes reconstruction performance

### Verified Storage Savings

**Test Workload:** 1MB file, 20 versions with 10% changes each
- **Without diffs:** 21MB total storage
- **With diffs:** 3MB total storage (3 snapshots + 17 diffs)
- **Savings:** 85.7%

**Real-World Projections:**
- ML checkpoints (1GB, 10% changes): 80-90% savings
- Config files (small, frequent changes): 75-85% savings
- Identical files (deduplication): 50% savings

### Testing

**New Tests:**
- `TestDiffChain20Plus`: 25 versions with periodic snapshots.
- `TestDiffChainStorageSavings`: Verified 85.7% reduction.

**Total Test Coverage:**
- 72 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- 25 main tests + 45 pkg tests + 2 new diff chain tests
- All integration tests passing

### Documentation

**New Documentation Files:**
- `docs/history/v1.0-final-complete.md`: Comprehensive implementation summary
- `docs/releases/release-notes.md`: This file
- Updated `README.md`: v1.0 Final status, verified benchmarks

**Updated Documentation:**
- README: Storage savings updated to 85.7% (measured)
- README: Roadmap updated to show v1.0 Final complete
- README: Status badge changed to green "v1.0 Final"

### Migration from v1.0-rc1

**Automatic Migration:**
- Existing deployments automatically migrate to new schema
- BaseSnapshotCID added to existing metadata
- No manual intervention required
- Backward compatible with MVP mode

**Changes:**
- Snapshot-only fallback removed (diff mode now default)
- Diff chains now accumulate properly
- Periodic snapshots enabled (configurable interval)

### Known Limitations

1. **Chunked File Diffs:**
   - Current: Falls back to snapshot if chunk count changes
   - Future: Per-chunk diff chain support

2. **Platform Support:**
   - Agent runs on Linux containers only (Unix syscalls)
   - Build on Windows/Mac, deploy to Linux

3. **High-Write Workloads:**
   - Current: <10k writes/sec recommended
   - Future (v2.0): eBPF hooks for higher throughput

### Next Steps (v1.1)

**Planned for Next Release:**
- [ ] Production testing (Docker + Kubernetes)
- [ ] Real ML checkpoint workload (PyTorch/TensorFlow)
- [ ] Kubernetes StatefulSet manifests
- [ ] Migration guide (MVP → v1.0)
- [ ] Official Docker image

### Installation

```bash
# Build from source
git clone https://github.com/saworbit/diffkeeper
cd diffkeeper
go build -o diffkeeper .

# Run with binary diffs enabled
./diffkeeper --enable-diff=true --snapshot-interval=10 \
  --state-dir=/app/data --store=/deltas/db.bolt \
  your-app-command
```

### Bug Fixes

**Fixed in v1.0 Final:**
1. Diff reconstruction returning raw patch data (now properly applies diffs)
2. Migration deadlock with nested transactions (refactored to avoid)
3. Merkle tree built before diff chain accumulation (now built after)
4. Force-snapshot mode preventing real diff mode (now removed)

### Breaking Changes

**None!** Fully backward compatible with v1.0-rc1 and MVP mode.

## Upgrade Guide

### From v1.0-rc1 to v1.0 Final

**No action required!** Automatic migration:
1. Stop DiffKeeper agent
2. Replace binary with v1.0 Final
3. Restart agent with `--enable-diff=true`
4. Existing data automatically migrated

**New CLI Flags:**
- `--snapshot-interval=10` (default: 10 versions)

**Behavior Changes:**
- Diffs now accumulate in chains (more storage savings)
- Periodic snapshots created automatically
- Recovery uses proper diff chain reconstruction

### From MVP to v1.0 Final

**Automatic Schema Migration:**
1. Set `--enable-diff=true` flag
2. Agent detects MVP schema and migrates
3. Existing compressed files → CAS snapshots
4. Merkle trees generated for integrity

**Migration Log:**
```
[Migration] Migrating schema from v1 to v2...
[Migration] Migrated N files from MVP to binary diffs
[Migration] Schema migration completed successfully
```
